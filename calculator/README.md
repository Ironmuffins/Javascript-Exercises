The goal for this exercise is to create a calculator that does the following:

add, subtract, get the sum, multiply, get the power, and find the factorial

In order to do this please fill out each function with your solution. Make sure to return the value so you can test it in Jasmine! To see the expected value
take a look at the spec file that houses the Jasmine test cases.

Features implemented:
Created functions for add, subtract, sum, multiply, get power, and find the factorial.

Features to be added in future update:
None (possibly condensing code)
